Version 0.1
-----------

**Released on Nov 18, 2017.**

This is an Alpha version for previewing. You can expect there are many
features missing, however the client part works well enough. These APIs are
considered stable enough to use in production:

- (stable) :class:`~authlib.client.OAuth1Session`
- (stable) :class:`~authlib.client.OAuth2Session`
- (beta) :class:`~authlib.client.OAuthClient`
- (beta) :class:`authlib.client.flask.OAuth`
