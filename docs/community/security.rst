Security Vulnerability
======================

If you think you have found a potential security vulnerability in Authlib,
please email <me@lepture.com> directly. Do not file a public issue.

Please do not disclose this to anyone else. We will retrieve a CVE identifier
if necessary and give you full credit under whatever name or alias you provide.
We will only request an identifier when we have a fix and can publish it in
a release.
