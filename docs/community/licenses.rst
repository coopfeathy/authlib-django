The content of the commercial license can be found in the repository in a file
named **COMMERCIAL-LICENSE**. You can buy a license at:

Discuss on License
------------------

There is a discuss on the license issue. I personally don't think AGPL is a
good license for Authlib either. If you have a better understanding of licenses
issues, you can offer your suggestions at:

https://github.com/lepture/authlib/issues/59

.. note::
    Authlib will be separated into 3 modules in the future. The client part
    will be licensed under BSD, the server part will remain AGPL (or BSD with
    Common Clause).
