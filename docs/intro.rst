Introduction
============

Authlib is a ready to use library for authentication. It was designed to be a
replacement for my Flask-OAuthlib project. Later it becomes a :ref:`monolithic`
project that powers from low-level specification implementation to high-level
framework integrations.

I'm intended to make it profitable, so that it can be :ref:`sustainable`.
